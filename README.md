# MP4
A Pure Javascript Mp4 Container Parser Based On ISO_IEC_14496-12

# Notice

This package is still incubating and is now some what functional

# Purpose
To create a pure javascript Mp4 container parser to spec with ISO_IEC_14496-12. This does not mean supporting codec demuxing or muxing for decoding and encoding. There are plenty of other modules out there to do just that. This mp4 package is a raw mp4 container parser which may then be utilized to then create muxers, demuxers, new codecs, and so on.
